# Observation

##### Origin type 1
$$\hat{X}(0)= id$$ and $$\xi^\circ=\hat{\xi}(0)$$

##### Origin type 2
$$\xi^\circ=(I_4, 0)$$ and the corresponding $$\hat{X}(0)$$ such that $$\phi(\hat{X}(0),\xi^\circ)=\hat{\xi}(0)$$

##### Origin type 3
Change $$C^\circ$$ in such a way that $$x_{P^\circ}$$ is the average of $$p^\circ_i$$ so that $$y_i^\circ$$ will be distributed around the origin
