# Equivariant Filter

These set of codes include error propagation (from the measurements to the filter).

### Steps

- Run the [simulator.m](https://github.com/HiyaGada/SLAM_internship/blob/main/EqF_noise/simulator.m) file
- Run the [EqF_w_noise.m](https://github.com/HiyaGada/SLAM_internship/blob/main/EqF_noise/EqF_w_noise.m) file
- OR use the already generated data in the [EqF_variables.mat](https://github.com/HiyaGada/SLAM_internship/blob/main/EqF_noise/EqF_variables.mat) file
